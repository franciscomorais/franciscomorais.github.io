    <h1>Token acquisition (October)</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This page was created to inform you how to proceed with the acquisition of Mint tokens. Before making your investment, please read the points below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Token acquisition fees will be split proportionally based on the percentage of the investment of all participants in this acquisition.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>After acquiring the tokens, the user can request a withdrawal to a wallet that supports the token (ex: metamask). However, the cost of fees will be supported by the user.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Please take a special attention that this is a high risk investment. Changes in price of the token can happen quickly, and the pool reaction may be very slow.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <br/>

    <h3>
      Investment procedure:
    </h3>

    <br />

    <p>
      The investment will take place if the pool manages to gather the minimum investment value. For this we will simulate a deposit to see if we have enough funds to proceed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please follow the steps below on the pmpool slyk:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Go to the last tab and click on Add Funds. Inside this feature, you must fill the amount in ETH you wish to invest and the address from which you will send the funds.
      </li>

      <li>
        Copy the destination address, but do not send the funds yet. You will be notified to send if the pool reaches the minimum value. Ensure that you complete the flow to success screen.
      </li>

      <li>
        After that, you will be notified via whatsapp to send the funds. Please take a special attention to whatsapp because you will have a short time to execute this steps.
